Feature: Change description New to New Car Purchase
  Displaying description name as New
  As a user that makes little confusion
  I want to see description as New Car Purchase

  Scenario: GP Item description listing New instead of New Car Purchase
    Given invoice billing type is PPSMONTH
    Given Min Approved Date and Min Sale Date
    And click on Preview Sales
    And select invoice and add it to the Working Batch
    And Publish invoice from Working Batch
    When we publish working batch to GP
    Then log into GP and verify invoice description is displaying "New" which should not do that

  Scenario: GP Item description should display New Car Purchase instead of New
    Given invoice billing type as PPS
    Given Min Approved Date and Min Sale Date
    And click on Preview Sales
    And Select invoice and add it to the Working Batch
    And Publish working batch
    When we publish working batch to GP
    Then log into GP and verify invoice description is displaying "New Car Purchase" which is correct display
